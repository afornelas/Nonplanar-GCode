    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside avian bones, two major features occur in the thin walled ellipsoid that greatly decrease the maximum stress and reduce local buckling: Ridges and Struts. In order to manufacture an avian bone inspired bumper, we require 3 major parts: the thin walled ellipsoid (mimiced with Epoxy), Struts (mimiced in nylon rods manufactured in this program), and ridges (along direction of rod mimiced with a lightweight fiber matrix). The struts discussed function best at an angle, this program will parametrically create nonplanar GCode based on specified parameters in order to make a manufacturable strut \"skeleton\" to create the synthetic avian bone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to mimic struts using additive manufacturing techniques, custom G-Code is written for the Ender 2 Pro and Ultimaker S5 to be able to print in all 3 cartesian directions simulataneously. By doing this we avoid the common additive manufacturing problem of poor layer adhesion negatively impacted curved components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement n-gon arcs that follow points in 2D\n",
    "- Translate points by an angle across Z\n",
    "- Given collection of movements, create GCode encoding instrutions\n",
